* As a user of Metagon, you provide data to us, 0131 Bot Services, in the form of messages and user identifiers (Names and platforms, that's all), we call them **Customer Data**. Metagon will only use said Customer Data to process your request and to function properly. In addition, starting from January 25, 2018, we no longer store such data, unless you use the Feedback function to reach us.
  * Metagon is running on a VPS provided by [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Please review [Heroku's Security page](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security), [Heroku's Trust & Compliance Documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Heroku-Trust-and-Compliance-Documentation&language=en_US&type=1), and [Saleforce's Privacy Statement](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/full_privacy/) (Especially section 10). Apparently, Heroku uses AWS infrastructure, so please also review [AWS's Data Privacy page](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/compliance/data-privacy-faq/).
  * Metagon is using [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://botframework.com) to route your message, as well as [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.com) to provide statistics. Please review [Microsoft's Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/privacy). (Note that the cloud service privacy policy applies here, not the regular Outlook/Bing one.)
  * Metagon is using an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) database provided by [mLab](http://mlab.com) to store session data. Please refer to [AWS's Data Privacy page](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/?nc1=f_ls).
  * **Feedback function only:** Metagon is using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/privacy) to route your messages. Please review [IFTTT's privacy policy](https://ifttt.com/privacy). In addition, if you provide your personal information, it will be made available to us in order to further contact you.
* 0131 Bot Services will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

If you do not accept any one of above, please stop using Metagon.
