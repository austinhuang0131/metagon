## Anime Images
### Pixiv
Searches images from [pixiv](http://pixiv.net).

* Command Entry: `/pixiv <Query>`

#### Query

* `Query`: Include this tag.
* `-Query`: Exclude this tag.
* ` ` separates tags when multiple tags are present.

For users who chose not to display NSFW content, `-R-18 -R-18G` is automatically enabled at the end of your query.

Japanese tags are suggested, as the majority pixiv users are Japanese (But there are also a lot of Chinese which is sometimes considered as a majority too, as well as some Koreans and Americans. Chinese users use Japanese tags to label their work for more traffic, but Koreans and Americans don't. *Who knows.*).

### IbSearch
Searches images from [IbSearch.xxx](http://ibsearch.xxx) which covers most boorus (gelbooru, danbooru, rule34, furrybo, yandere, konachan, safebooru, xbooru, e621, Überbooru).

For users who chose not to display NSFW content, `rating:s` is automatically enabled at the end of your query.

* Command Entry: `/ibsearch [Query]`

#### Query
For all queries, `random: ` is added before your query to increase randomness of the result (So you are more likely getting different images when you execute it multiple times. Wait, *why do you execute it multiple times?*).

* `Query`: Include this tag.
* `-Query`: Exclude this tag.
* Space separates tags.
* There's no tags with space. However when you need them, use `_`, for example `animal_ears`.
* For other rules click [here](https://ibsearch.xxx/api/v1/images#qtags). However, most of them are unnecessary.
