<h1>About Lydia itself</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Isn't the bot called <em>Metagon</em> before?</strong> Yes, you are right. It was served as a fork of the Discord bot. However the Discord-side developer left Discord and threw the project to another two people. You can read the somehow-detailed explanation <a href="https://gist.github.com/austinhuang0131/6385e8c91827aedd7a718ee2bce797ad#but-why">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>You said you are not associated with them...?</strong> I am not associated with them <i>de facto</i>, however, they <a href="stuff1.png">gave me permission to use the brand</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Why did you move out from Discord?</strong> Very simple. Discord bot market has been expanded too fast. And there are problems in the community. Actually, the problem is the same as in United States: Separation between normal citizens and elites. I think you will understand that.</li>
  <li><strong>Does hosting Lydia costs?</strong> I didn't even use a cent in Lydia: My VPS is free (Openshift Redhat v2, <i>no longer available for registration</i>), my APIs are free, and I am using an Uptime Robot to ping my VPS every 5 minutes so it will be technically 24/7.</li>
  </ul>
<h1>About Austin Huang</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Some basic intro...?</strong> I am just a 14-yr-old Chinese guy living in Montréal, Qc, Canada. I sometimes play Minecraft. What else do you want to know?</li>
  <li><strong>What is <code>+1 (289) 799-6618</code>?</strong> My <a href="http://nextplus.me">internet phone</a>. Acts like the customer support of Lydia. (Actually, if you check the origin of the number, it's from Hamilton, Ont. which is far from Montréal.) <i>Do you really think it's my real number?</i></li>
  <li><strong>My God. Do you hunt free stuff (and ruin them)?</strong> Since I believe that the possibility of receiving any donation to me is extremely low, I always use free stuff.</li>
